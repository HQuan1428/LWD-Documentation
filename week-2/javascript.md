# Javascript

## Why study Javascript? 
For me, It is a progamming language for web development. Anyone who wants to become a web developer starts with it and I am no exception ^_^.

For technique, **JS** to program the behavior of web pages.

## Core Javascript Fundamentals.

### Syntax and Basics.

Variables(**let, const, var**)
- JS variables can be declared in 4 ways:
  - Automaticlly.
  - Using **var**
  - Using **let**
  - Using **const**
- Example:
```js
x = 5 // Automaticlly
var y = 6 // Using var
let z = 7 // Using let
const t = 8 // Using const
```
- When to use **var, const, let**?
    1. Always declare variables.
    2. Always use **const** if they value should not be changed.
    3. Always use **const** if the type should not be changed (Arrays or Objects)
    4. Only use **let** if you can't use **const**.
    5. Only use **var** if you MUST support older browsers.
- The general rules for constructing names for variables(unique identifiers) are:
  - Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
  - Names must begin with a letter.
  - Name can also begin with $ and _.
  - Names are case sensitve (y ane Y are different variables).  
  - Reserved words (like JS keywords) cannot be used as usual.
